  "summary": "The diff largely implements a static South Essentials storefront (hero + categories + products + client-side cart) and updates SEO metadata, but the tagline is not used exactly as specified in prominent UI text, and there is no evidence that the required generated image files were added under frontend/public/assets/generated.",

      "requirement": "Use the tagline exactly: \"your one stop shop for south indian products\" in prominent branding (hero/tagline text).",
